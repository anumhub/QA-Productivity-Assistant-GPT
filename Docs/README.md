# QA Productivity Assistant (Custom GPT)

A Custom GPT designed to help manual and hybrid QA engineers with requirement analysis, test design, test data suggestions, and basic defect triage.

## Problem
Manual test planning and test case design are time-consuming and inconsistent across teams.

## Solution
This Custom GPT embeds a QA analyst mindset and structured output formats so testers can use short prompts without repeating context.

## Key Capabilities
- Requirement analysis and risk identification
- Structured functional test case generation
- Edge case and negative scenario coverage
- Test data suggestions
- Bug report improvement + severity/priority guidance
- Test coverage gap detection

## Project Artifacts
- `Docs/` – Setup guide (how to create and configure the Custom GPT)
- `Prompts/` – 10 sample prompts to demonstrate real usage + System Instructions used in custom GPT configurations
- `Video/` – Demo video links (videos hosted on Google Drive due to GitHub file size limits)
- `how-to-use/`- sample feature Requirement text file, sample user story text file , sample defect report text file for demo


## How to Use
This project includes realistic QA samples to quickly demonstrate the Custom GPT capabilities.

1. Open any sample file from the `how-to-use/` folder:
   - User Story
   - Feature Requirement
   - Defect Report

2. Paste the content into the QA Productivity Assistant (Custom GPT).

3. Use the sample prompts from `prompts/sample-prompts.md` to:
   - Analyze requirements
   - Generate test cases
   - Identify edge cases
   - Suggest test data
   - Perform defect triage

## Tools
- ChatGPT Custom GPT (configured instructions)
- Prompt engineering for QA workflows
